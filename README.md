# euC

~~Project Euler in C programming language.~~

This project has become more like euJ. I am working to `master` java and in the 
process I have no time to learn C (sadly :( .



## Installation

- Install MinGW folder: https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/downloads/68260/mingw-get-setup.exe/

## Compile

- Direct to the path that contains the executable file. For instance: `set1\eu1.cpp`
- Run the code: `g++ filename.cpp`. This will generate an executable file ususally with name `a.exe`
- run the executable file: `./a.exe`. Get the output.
