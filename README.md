# euC
Project Euler in C++

## Installation

- Install MinGW folder: https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/downloads/68260/mingw-get-setup.exe/

## Compile

- Direct to the path that contains the executable file. For instance: `set1\eu1.cpp`
- Run the code: `g++ filename.cpp`. This will generate an executable file ususally with name `a.exe`
- run the executable file: `./a.exe`. Get the output.

## Terminology

- A method is a member function (Cpp term). A method is a function within a class.
- Cpp can have functions outside the class. Java does not.

## New Training

euC has to be solved with java instead of C++. This is due to client requirements and bussiness needs. Java is a bussiness bean.
